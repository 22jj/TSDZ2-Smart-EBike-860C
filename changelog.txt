TSDZ2 Open Source Firmware v20.1C.2 for 860C display

  1 - Updated to v12 version of mspider65 (Hall sensor calibration missing)
  2 - Improved the problem of delay in restarting with bike in motion (from mspider65 v12)
  3 - Improved standing start response.
  4 - Decreased eMTB torque offset, it was too sensitive at the start.
  5 - Added "Motor fast stop" for a quick stop of the motor.
  6 - Added "Motor deceleration" adjustable 0-100%, alternative to "Motor fast stop".
  7 - Speed sensor error threshold time increased (E08).
  8 - Added enable / disable "Field Weakening".
  9 - PWM display in percentage 0-100%
 10 - Added to 860C, Motor power threshold (auto / manual) for field and graph.

TSDZ2 Open Source Firmware v20.1C for 860C display

Motor changes
  1 - Added field weakening function to increase the motor speed (by mspider65).
  2 - Added other optimizations to motor control, torque sensor and cadence sensor (by mspider65).
  3 - Added startup boost function in POWER assist mode, enable/disable and parameters at display.
  4 - Added HYBRID assist mode, TORQUE + POWER, can be set on the display.
  5 - Improved "Start-up without pedal rotation" function.
  6 - Added a filter to the speed sensor to avoid problems of adjusting the distance from the magnet.
  7 - Added error E03 cadence sensor failure.
  8 - Added error E04 torque sensor failure.
  9 - Added error E08 due to speed sensor failure or missing magnet.
 10 - Added "Assist with sensors error" function, to force assistance with sensors problem.
